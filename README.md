# MATLAB-cheminformatics
A collection of MATLAB live scripts useful for compiling chemical data
and literature. MATLAB live scripts (`*.mlx`) are in the `/live_scripts` folder.
An equivalent plain text version is also included (`.m`). The MATLAB live
scripts can be previewed as HTML formatted documents via the hyper links below:

1. PubChem_SDQ_Bibliometrics

Count references and data in PubChem associated with a CID
(e.g., from PubMed, Patent, Springer Nature, and Thieme Literature and bioactivity)

2. PubChem_SDQ_LitSearch

Search PubChem for PubMed, Patent, Springer Nature, and Thieme Literature associated with a CID

3. [PubChem_Similarity](https://vfscalfani.github.io/MATLAB-cheminformatics/live_scripts_html/PubChem_Similarity.html):
Search for chemical structures in PubChem via a Fingerprint Tanimoto Similarity Search

4. PubChem_SMARTS

Search for chemical structures in PubChem via a SMARTS substructure query and compile results

5. PubChemSDfiles_extract

Extract data from PubChem SDfiles using a text-based approach
